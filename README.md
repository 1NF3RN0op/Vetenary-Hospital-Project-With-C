Here, you can run a pet vetenary hospital with C programming, there is 3 types of user, Admin, Doctor and Patient. Admin username and password is fixed in the code.
Admin Username: admin
Admin Password: admin123
You can change them in the code, but for now it is default for now. Admin can add or remove doctor, check hospital revenew and how many patient visited.
Doctors can login with those username and password which are already inputed by admin, otherwise doctor can't enter into the system. Doctor can see how many patient have come and there can be multiple doctor and each doctor have their own id and various number of patients. Doctor can review all the patient and prescribe medicines. Also they can write how much it'll cost to the patients.
Patients, or you can say pets owner can login (if the user is already registered) or they can get registered if they are new here. Then the patient can give info about there pet and select which doctor they want to check their pets, by selecting them the payment done automatically. Also they can see what the doctor prescribed for there pet.
